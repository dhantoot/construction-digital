# 1. Dashboard page

## Reference Files
- ./src/components/DashBoard.vue

## Task

- [ ] Update the mobile Dashboard widget the same as the admin dashboard to show the following:
  - Work Due
  - Planned Work
  - Actual Work
  - Work Done

- [ ] The mobile dashboard should only show one widget for the projects, the same as the admin dashboard wherein only one widget is shown from whatever is selected in the dropdown.

- [ ] The difference is that the mobile dashboard stats should be dependent on the type of user. If admin then do the same calculation as the admin dashboard. If not admin, then do the calculation based on the user's assigned projects.

- [ ] Use the same code structure and pattern in place.

For this task, focus on the tasks and projects schema located at ./Todos/hofstee-app-default-rtdb-exports.json.
