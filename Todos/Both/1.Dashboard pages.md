## Reference Files
- ./src/components/DashBoard.vue

## Task

- [ ] Can you recomment a better way for the two stats: "Planned Works" and "Actual Work" ? seems like its misleading or unclear.
maybe place the target work ? since in the graph/chart i used Target Work.
- [ ] Whatever your suggestion, make sure to update the mobile dashboard as well.
- [ ] Use the same code structure and pattern in place.

For this task, focus on the tasks and projects schema located at ./Todos/hofstee-app-default-rtdb-exports.json.
i have exported it from the firebase console.
